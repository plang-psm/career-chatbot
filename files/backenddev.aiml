            Summary: In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend 
            (sometimes written as back end or back-end) refer to the separation 
            of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data 
            access layer (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure 
            or hardware. In the clientâ€“server model, the client is usually considered 
            the frontend and the server is usually considered the backend, even when 
            some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.
